INPUT FILES FOLDER
--------------------

1. Ascending_input  :-   contains 10 input files, each sorted in ascending order
2. Descending_input :-   contains 10 input files, each sorted in descending order
3. Random_input     :-   contains 10 input files, each in random order

Format of each input file
    For Example:- asc_input-xxxx.txt
        
    xxxx   <---- number of elements in the file.
    5      <----  input elements starts.

OUTPUT FILES FOLDER
---------------------

contains 30 output files.

Bubble Sort

    asc_output-XXX.txt  :- It contains output of ascending order input data containing xxxx no of elements.
    desc_output-XXX.txt :- It contains output of descending order input data containing xxxx no of elements.
    rnd_output-XXX.txt  :- It contains output of random order input data containing xxxx no of elements.

Insertion Sort

    Since same output is generated ,the output files are not included in this case.

GRAPHS
